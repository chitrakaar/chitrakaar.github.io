Cloth bags and metal or glass reusable bottles are available locally at great prices.</li><li>Refuse single-serving packaging, excess packaging, straws and other "disposable" plastics. Carry reusable utensils in your purse, backpack or car to use at bbq's, potlucks or take-out restaurants.</li><li>Reduce everyday plastics such as sandwich bags and juice cartons by replacing them with a reusable lunch bag/box that includes a thermos.</li><li>Bring your to-go mug with you to the coffee shop, smoothie shop or restaurants that let you use them, which is a great way to reduce lids, plastic cups and/or plastic-lined cups.</li><li>Go digital! No need for plastic cds, dvds and jewel cases when you can buy your music and videos online.</li><li>Seek out alternatives to the plastic items that you rely on.</li><li>Recycle. If you must use plastic, try to choose #1 (PETE) or #2 (HDPE), which are the most commonly recycled plastics. Avoid plastic bags and polystyrene foam as both typically have very low recycling rates.</li><li>Volunteer at a beach cleanup. <a href=http://www.surfrider.org/chapters target=_blank><span style=color:#529546>Surfrider Foundation Chapters</span></a> often hold cleanups monthly or more frequently.</li><li>Support plastic bag bans, polystyrene foam bans and bottle recycling bills.</li><li>Spread the word. Talk to your family and friends about why it is important to reduce plastic in our lives and the nasty impacts of plastic pollution.</li></ul></div><div class=col-md-4><div class="card my-4"><h5 class=card-header>Categories</h5><div class=card-body><div><ul class="list-unstyled mb-0"><li><a href=#section1>Facts About Plastic Pollution</a></li><li><a href=#section2>Things We Can Do About Plastic Waste</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class=custom-footer><div class=text-center><ul class=list-inline><li class=list-inline-item><a><i id=social-fb class="fa fa-facebook-square fa-3x social"></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a><i id=social-tw class="fa fa-twitter-square fa-3x social"></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=mailto:waterstore@gmail.com><i id=social-em class="fa fa-envelope-square fa-3x social"></i></a></li><li class=list-inline-item><a href=/contact target=_self class="fa fa-3x social" style=border-radius:9px;><span><i class="fa fa-phone-square fa-1x" style=margin-right:7px;></i>(973) 957-0655</span></a></li></ul></div></footer><script src=vendor/jquery/jquery.min.js></script><script src=vendor/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script></body></html>
